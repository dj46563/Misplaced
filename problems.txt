Problems:

- Server recognizes player count based on people who have connected not shaken hands
  - When the server is extremely slow, this can cause it to fail, goes to builder mode and nobody
    is builder

- Smooth the light
- Light doesnt go through walls

todo:

- explode if got something wrong
- bug: extra players cant see old players characters
- improve: maybe zoom out camera more in searching view
- remove names from head, pointer for your character
- leaderboard in waiting/begin room

did:
- improve: let camera move in smaller increments
- improve: make skybox same color at outside walls
